MIDAIR PHYSICS
 
If Small, Big, Fiery or Hammer Mario:
- Releasing B and/or Left/Right has no effect on your speed.
- Holding the direction of motion accelerates you at a rate of 0.0546875 px/f^2 (up to 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 px/f)
- Holding the direction opposite motion decelerates you at a rate of 0.125 px/f^2
 
If Raccoon or Tanooki Mario and NOT in flight mode,
- Releasing Left/Right decelerates you at a rate of about 0.0625 px/f^2 until you reach a speed of 1.4375 px/f
- Holding the direction of motion accelerates you at a rate of 0.0546875 px/f^2 (up to 1.5 or 2.5 px/f)
- Holding the direction opposite motion decelerates you at a rate of 0.1875 px/f^2
 
If Raccoon or Tanooki Mario and in flight mode,
- Even when holding B and the direction of flight, you will decelerate at a rate of 0.015625 px/f^2 until you reach a speed of 1.4375 px/f
- Releasing Left/Right decelerates you at a rate of 0.0625 px/f^2 until you reach a speed of 1.4375 px/f
- Holding the direction of motion accelerates you at a rate of 0.0546875 px/f^2 (up to 1.4375 px/f)
- Holding the direction opposite motion decelerates you at a rate of 0.1875 px/f^2
