## Abstract
The research outlined in this report documents the research, design, development and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Controller. That utilises an Artificial Neural Network for the brain of the player that is evolved through Genetic Algorithms. The Genetic Algorithm that has being used throughout is that of Neural Evolution of Augmenting topologies. In the hopes it will be able to see a 2D platformer level built for the purpose of this research to completion. 
Once capable of completing the level it will be put to Turing test; which is designed to see if a machine can exhibit intelligent behaviour in a similar manner to that of a human. The videogame industry is constantly pushing the boundaries on realistic graphics. But the methods utilised for Artificial Intelligence rather than exhibiting life-like intelligence, merely give the appearance of intelligence. It is the hope that this paper will encourage the use of approaches like these. 
With the hope it can be an alternative or a replace for the industry standard method having the intelligence match the visuals. The evaluation will focus on the analysation of the sufficient inputs structure for the ANN to complete the level. And its ability to fool human evaluator into thinking it is a human player.

## Project Description
![mario](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b68389c4-f835-4ce8-8cce-f93f4319b76b)

During my time at university, I employed SFML to build a replica of Super Mario World: Yoshi island 1, that can be played manually for debugging purposes. When utilising the artificial controller it utilises a genetic algorithm to control the level automatically. I have incorporating more prevalent contemporary C++ techniques into the implementation. An occasion to demonstrate my development as a programmer during my tenure in the industry.

I aim to continue to implement the following:
- [x] refactor the code.
- [ ] optimise the collision code.
- [ ] seperate the 2d test bed for other uses.
