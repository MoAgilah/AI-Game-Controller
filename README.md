# MastersDissertation
Using an Artificial Intelligence Controller to complete a level of a 2D platformer testbed in a way indistinguishable from a human player was my master's dissertation. It saw the creation of a super mario world level clone being built using SFML and implementing artificial intelligence controller. With the 2D testbed completed utilising the genetic algorithm of Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies or NEAT being the brain behind mario. It saw the A.I. controller successfully and consistently see the level to completion using the grid sensors but unsuccessfully with the line sensors. It was also playable from start to finish by a human player for testing, within the written counterpart is the submission I made alongside it.
